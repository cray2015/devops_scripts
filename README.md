# devops_scripts
Some basic devops scripts ranging from automation to installations.

I know the pain of repeated things so I wondered why not create scripts for automating my work and then I started creating bash scripts.

Until now I was using bash scripts to do my job but I thought there might be hundreds of others who must be facing the same thing. I decided to re write my scripts in Python for easy maintainance and better readability

This has given rise to a new project for me to practice and help others and somehow contribute to the OSS scene. 

# Testing
These scripts have been created while keeping in mind that it may function on both python2.7 and python3+ environments

Right now I'm testing these to work with Debian flavours

- [x] Python 2.7
- [x] Python 3+
- [x] Debian

In the coming days there might be test cases too to validate the CRs.
